# Rouge Access Portal
## Disclamer
The misuse of this software can result in criminal activities. The author(s) will not be held responsible for its abuse.
## Functions
A captive portal able to intercept DNS look-ups and give out a login interface according to the URL. Currently it implements Google, Facebook and Yahoo login masks but can be extended. Google sign-in template is the default one.<br>
When the user connects for the first time from a smartphone, a login portal pops up asking to perform the signin in order to start browsing and, after the data is sent, an error is retrieved.<br>
Login data is then stored in the flash memory of the ESP8266 and can be seen visiting anydomain.com/esportal/log<br>
The built-in LED will blink 10 times to confirm successful start-up and 5 times when a user logs in.
